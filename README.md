Grace Madison Wu <br>
Rising Sophomore (Junior Standing), Columbia University <br>
Major: Financial Engineering | Minors: Sustainable Engineering, Applied Math

Driven by a passion for numbers and nature, I am fascinated by the intersection of data, finance, and sustainability. My interests include sustainable and impact investing, quantitative research, and environmental risk management.

I bring extensive experience in Python, with proficiency in machine learning and data science libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, and Seaborn. Through Break Through Tech AI, Iâ€™ve applied advanced ML and deep learning models to real-world business challenges in collaboration with industry partners. My research at UW-Madison's Materials Science and Engineering department further honed my analytical and data-driven problem-solving skills

Leadership and collaboration are central to my approach:

* As Vice President of my class, I partner with administrators and committees to organize community initiatives, manage finances, and enhance the student experience.<br>
* As Vice President of Columbia Lioness Quantitative (sponsored by Hudson River Trading, Citadel, and TraderMath), I help develop quantitative finance curricula and facilitate connections with leading firms, supporting womenâ€™s inclusion in the field.<br><br>

I am eager to pursue opportunities in sustainable investment and quantitative trading development. Long term, I aspire to launch a startup focused on sustainability or animal welfare, leveraging data and innovation for real-world impact.
